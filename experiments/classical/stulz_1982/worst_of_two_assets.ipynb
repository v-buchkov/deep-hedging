    "It is no secret for anyone that the past period of QE have driven CBs around the world to the point, where they need to switch to QT very rapidly. Therefore, current high level of interest rates across the globe has allowed economies to slow down to presumably sufficient speed of growth (i.e., inflation has successfully slowed down).\n",

    "The idea is to use the prediction for our advantage via trading second moments of the stock returns. As the **interest rates will go down**, investors that aim to have stable fixed income will likely start to look into **another sources of cash flows, such as dividend stocks**. Therefore, as many investors will sell bonds and **enter dividend stocks simultaneously, their correlation is expected to rise**.\n",
